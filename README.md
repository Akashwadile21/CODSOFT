PROJECT

1. [TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION](https://github.com/Akashwadile21/CODSOFT/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)
This project is centered on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It encompasses crucial data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the dataset, enabling effective analysis. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we dive deep into the dataset, utilizing visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover meaningful patterns related to passenger demographics, cabins, fares, and more. The core of the project lies in building a predictive model using machine learning techniques, which estimates survival probabilities for Titanic passengers.

2. [MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON](https://github.com/Akashwadile21/CODSOFT/blob/main/IMDB/IMDB_Indian_Movies.ipynb)
In this Project,I build a movie rating prediction system using python and use machine learning model to predict movie rating.

3.IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
In this Project analysis the different types of Iris flower species and visulization on their species.also perform machine learning .
